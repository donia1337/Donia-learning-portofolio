# Donia-learning-portofolio

The purpose of this repository, is to learn myself, Dominika, how to code in languages such as Python, Javascript, Bash, and so on, using Github. The goal with building this repository, is to teach myself the skills required to work in the software industry, where as of writing this in August 2023, I have a strong dream, desire and goal to become a skilled cloud developer.

With this portofolio you can see my journey, with all of my commits.

Everything is self-taught by reading articles, youtube or learn by doing tutorials.
