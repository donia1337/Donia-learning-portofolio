# Little practice with string concatenation (how to put strings together).
# Let say we want to create a string that say: "All the dogs are ______".

dogs = "lovely and beautiful"

# We can do this in few different ways:

print("All the dogs are " + dogs)
print("All the dogs are {}".format(dogs))
print(f"All the dogs are {dogs}")
