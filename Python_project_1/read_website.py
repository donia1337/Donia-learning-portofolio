# This script should be able to read a website and save an url that holds json data.
# For this example we are using: https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast

# We could for now ignore this script and just always use the "latest" data source which would be at:
# https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/ovation_aurora_latest.json
